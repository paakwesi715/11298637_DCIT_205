# what i have learnt thus far
Embarking on this project has been of much benefit to me in so many aspect such that it has created the environment for me where i had  to do some  sort of research  both written and visual ; google and youtube respectively. Also working on this project has inculcated some sort of enthusiasm as far as website development is concerned. In a nut shell , i look forward to again embark on other project as far as upgrading myself in the area of web development for the job market is concerned.
